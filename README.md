# Milestone_Project_Web_Game
A basic basketball game that was designed to kill time..
The basketball hoop is an AI that basically moves back and forth... forever...
You press the "up" arrow key to shoot the ball vertically and try to make it into the hoop.
There are some bugs that are still occuring such as canvas text staying on the screen once you score or miss.
Music seems to only work for me when i load the page even through the github link..
Seems like these are the two things i need to fix.
Room for improvement for sure but had a lot of fun.

Researched a lot of information from w3schools and MDN. Some information was from previous assignments from the bootcamp.
Please let me know if you have any questions!
